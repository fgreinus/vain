# Vain

Vain is a composition of features ranging from content management up to community integration. It is highly extensible and heavenly clean - not least because of the Laravel Framework (currently used in version 5.1).

Further information may be found in the documentation (see above) or on the project's website: [vain.rocks](http://www.vain.rocks). Yes, vain rocks!

## Documentation

Documentation for the project can be found on [Vain's Github Wiki](https://github.com/fgreinus/vain/wiki).

## Issue Reporting

If you file a bug report, your issue should contain a title and a clear description of the issue. You should also include as much relevant information as possible and a code sample that demonstrates the issue. The goal of a bug report is to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and develop a fix.

Please use [Vain's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/fgreinus/vain/issues) to report issues.
